#Week 1 Notes- Programming in C

main is same as green flag clicked in scratch

printf- f is for formatted

./ run the program in my current directory

get_string- gets a string from standard input (cs50.h)

	string answer = get_string("What is your name? \n");

ALWAYS start with very first error message if compiler lists a lot of mistakes

	string.c:5:5
string.c line 5 character 5

make [program name] 
looks for the .c file associated compiles and links

assignment from right to left

i is convention for counter integer

balance nesting functions for concise code vs easy to read code- design decision nuances

computers can only store finite amount of info

1 / 10 will not perfectly be .1 if you let out enough decimal places

when run out of bits in storage space get an overflow and computer will restart at 0. adds a flag for overflow- like carrying the 1

integer overflow -> Y2K
