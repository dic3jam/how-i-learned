# CS50 Week 0 Introduction

computer science is process of solving problems

have input want output- CS is inbetween

first concept how represent info itself

 unary notation- counting 1 at a time

binary uses powers of 10

2^4 2^2 2

421

000

011

4x0 + 2x1 + 1x1 = 3

create characters by representing with numbers- ASCII

unicode superset of ascii for other langauges and emojis

represent colors with numbers- mixing RGB

each pixel has 3 numbers- tells how much red, green, and blue

**algorithim**- the inbetween of the input -> output box. step by step instruction for how to go from input to output

problem solving just translating your intuition to something machine understands

**functions**- actions what to do 
**conditions**- branches forks in the road
to follow a branch need to ask question
**boolean expression**- the question with yes or no answer
**loop**- cycle that does something again and again
**variables
threads**

##Scratch

 circular are varaibles. trapezoids are booleans

broadcast puzzle piece sends event- computers can look for events from one program to another

can make your own blocks- aka functions or objects

build program a piece at a time
