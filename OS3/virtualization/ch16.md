# Ch.16 Segmentation

just one base/bounds perprocess is wasteful

**segmentation** - have base/bounds per local segment of address space - heap, stack, code
- each can be placed independently

offset based on virtual segmentation- which bytes *in this segment* we are referring to
1. subtract the desired VIRTUAL address from the base VIRTUAL address
2. add the difference to the PHYSICAL base for that segment
- which means for a positive growing segment subtract from the physical end of the segment (not the "base")
- for a negative growing segment add to the actual base (if address is valid the desired v - v base will be negative, resulting in a valid address)

example bc ur dumb:

RG seed 0
ARG address space size 1k
ARG phys mem size 16k

Segment register information:

  Segment 0 base  (grows positive) : 0x00001aea (decimal 6890)
  Segment 0 limit                  : 472

  Segment 1 base  (grows negative) : 0x00001254 (decimal 4692)
  Segment 1 limit                  : 450

Virtual Address Trace
  VA  0: 0x0000020b (decimal:  523) --> SEGMENTATION VIOLATION (SEG1)
  VA  1: 0x0000019e (decimal:  414) --> VALID in SEG0: 0x00001c88 (decimal: 7304)
  VA  2: 0x00000322 (decimal:  802) --> VALID in SEG1: 0x00001176 (decimal: 4470)
  VA  3: 0x00000136 (decimal:  310) --> VALID in SEG0: 0x00001c20 (decimal: 7200)
  VA  4: 0x000001e8 (decimal:  488) --> SEGMENTATION VIOLATION (SEG0)

**NOTE FROM THE HOMEWORK**
- your segment 0's base maps to virtual address 0 in the virtual address space
- your segment 1's base maps to virtual address n for virtual address space of size n
- 

- so keep track of virtual base/bounds in software?? and physical in hardware?

One approach to segmentaion: **explicit**

uses the first 2 bits of an address to determine the segment (calculates with logical anding to masks then bitshifting)

**implicit** approach - 
hardware determines segment by noticing how the address was formed - ie:
- if instruction fetch then code segment
- based off stack pointer, on stack
- otherwise heap

soo since the stack could grow DOWN

we need..... MORE HARDWARE
- one approach: keep track of a bit 1 for negative 0 for positive
- speaking of that to get a negative offset:
1. subtract the maximum segment size from the requeted virtual offset (bottom bits of address) 
2. add that negative offset to PHYSICAL base
3. bounds check based upon absolute value of calculated negative offset

coarse-grained or fine-grained segmentation

soooo what about a context switch?

- add mechanisms to save and restore segment registers
- manage free space in memory with a data structure
||
**external fragmentation** - too many little holes in memory

one solution: compact physical memory by rearranging segments - but very costly

usually use some kind of algorithmic approach to allocate memory efficiently with the help of the free list
- many many ways to slice that cat
