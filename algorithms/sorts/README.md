#JimSort- A C program to determine real runtime of Selection and Insertion Sort

This program will allow you to run an insertion sort, and or a selection sort, either a specified number of times with a randomized array, or will automatically generate a test for both arrays. Results will be written to a text file called "sortResults.txt" for data processing.
