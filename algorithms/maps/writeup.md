So I just used google maps and got the travel times from each point of interest to its neighbors. These times can be drastically different depedning on which mode of travel so I just opted for a car. I belive the results are reasonable as I generally kept the nodes accessible throughout the trials. I ran into an issue where each time I googled the travel time it was different because of traffic. For consistency in representations sake this is the average time between points.
