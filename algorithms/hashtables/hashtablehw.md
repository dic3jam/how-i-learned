# Hash Table HW 1+2
## Jim DiCesare

1. As you approach 100% load in the hash table, linear probing causes insertions to the table to grow and grow until clusters begin to overlap with other clusters. That is why linear probing is only useful for smaller hash tables. Using a pseudorandom function for inserting values will not make look up impossible later as the probe for each hash will follow a predictable route (the pseudo portion of the pseudorandom).
