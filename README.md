# how-i-learned

This repository showcases some of the work I completed while I was self-taught, and also as a student at Vermont Technical College. 

## Summary of this repository:

### Self-Taught Work
C-21 - "Teach Yourself C in 21 Days" Well it was more like 24 but at least I taught myself.
CS50 - I completed the lectures and labs of the free online series from Harvard but timed out on completing the projects: I had to focus on my actual classes instead.
Hackerrank-practice - some of my hackerrank solutions from coding interview training
OS3 - Operating Systems : 3 easy pieces code, notes

### VTC Advanced Software Development Certificate and More
Java - My first formal programming course. I knew so little just 1 year ago.
Algorithms - Algorithms and Data Structures. This course was in C and I did a little bit of C++ at the end. I only included the notable programs. 
OOP - Object Oriented Programming taught in..... Java
WebDev - Web Development 2 - [Website](https://jmd06260.classweb.ccv.edu/AdvWeb/index.php)
