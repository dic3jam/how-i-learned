  <h2>Research</h2>
  <!--writeup goes here-->
  <p>Larry built up his example very slowly, and spends many pages going over exactly what each block of code is doing. W3Schools just kinda said "well here it is!" without much explanation. At this point in my education, I can do the W3 way (in fact it's easier for me) just because I know how the program is going to run, I just need to see the specific syntax for PHP. If I was just starting out, Larry's book would be a game changer. Especially if I had never been instructed on object oriented programming, or had not spent a lot of time digging through documentation and learning how to do that efficiently.</p>
