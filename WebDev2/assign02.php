  <h2>Assign02 - Advanced Web Development</h2>
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>I have used and am very familiar with Eclipse, VSCode, and Vim. I use Eclipse for Java programming, 
    and I love the debugger tools in VSCode (command line debuggers like gdb or pdb do not always offer 
    enough of a visual for me to understand the bug) and sometimes will use VSCode for Python or C projects, 
    but my favorite text editor is Vim. Admittedly I am such a Vim nut that when I am in VSCode or Eclipse I 
    have an extension turned on so I can keep using the Bim key bindings. I do as much of my coding in a terminal 
    with Vim as I can - I find all the gee-wiz gizmos that IDEs have to be distracting. I use a window plexing 
    terminal emulator (called Terminator- like tmux but better) and I have a few Vim plugins for syntactic highlighting. 
    I find my workflow for that to be very efficient. For this class though I believe I will try some more assignments with VSCode. 
    There are some extensions to aid with web development in VSCode that will far exceed my capabilities with a terminal and Vim</p> 
  <p>For Assignment 2 it is to research EDITORS. </p>
