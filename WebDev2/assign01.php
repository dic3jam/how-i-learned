  <h2>Assign01 - Advanced Web Development</h2>
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
Hello Everyone!

I apologize for being late to the party but I am also a student at VTC and my classes there do not start until next week, so I got a little confused. Nonetheless I am present and ready to get started.

I daily drive Linux but I also have access to Windows if need be. I tend to stick in the good zsh terminal so I usually use any tools related to that. I also have access to Microsoft Office products and am pretty familiar with using them. I am a former Army Officer who got out of the Army and (when I started having free time again) discovered a passion for computers and technology. I completed self-study for about a year, then enrolled in VTC's Advanced Software Development Certificate program. I already have a Bachelors degree in Business (kinda useless unless you want to be some flavor of a salesman). As such I know C, Java, Python, HTML/CSS (from web dev 1), SQL, bash scripting,  I have dabbled in assembly languages, and even an obscure language called Rockstar. 

I almost exclusively get my news from Hacker News so I am on there daily. I also watch a LOT of Youtube videos, so I am on there as well. When I took Web Development 1 last summer it was utilized content from w3schools. I have also used w3schools for other concepts as well. 

I am a pretty quick study in general so I should have no problem picking up what you're putting down. If I do not understand something and cannot find it on Google or in a book, I will send you a message.

Thanks,

Jim
